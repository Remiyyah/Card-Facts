           <p>Although they are smaller in size compared to other animals,<br>
             capyabras are actually the world's largest rodents! Their average <br>
            length ranges from 100 to 130 centimeters. The name "capybara" means <br>
            <em>"master of the grass"</em>, which is mainly the diet of these herbivores.</p>
